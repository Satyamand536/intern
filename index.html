        <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the <strong>natural intelligence</strong> displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "<a href="#">intelligent agents</a>": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

        <p>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the <a href="#">AI effect</a>. A quip in <a href="#">Tesler's Theorem</a> says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, <a href="#">optical character recognition</a> is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p>

          <div>The interaction between artificial intelligence and human intelligence represents one of the most significant technological developments of the 21st century.</div>
        </div>

        <p>Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully <a href="#">understanding human speech</a>, competing at the highest level in <a href="#">strategic game systems</a> (such as <a href="#">chess</a> and <a href="#">Go</a>), <a href="#">autonomously operating cars</a>, intelligent routing in <a href="#">content delivery networks</a>, and <a href="#">military simulations</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "<a href="#">AI winter</a>"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried many different approaches and has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.</p>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>The field of AI research was born at a workshop at <a href="#">Dartmouth College</a> in 1956, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. Early enthusiasm in the 1950s and 1960s, with great optimism about the possibilities, was followed by disappointment and the subsequent reduction in funding known as the first "AI winter" (1974–1980).</p>

          <div>Early computer systems laid the foundation for modern artificial intelligence development.</div>
        </div>

        <h3 id="early-work">Early work</h3>
        <p>The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer <a href="#">Alan Turing</a>. Turing's 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" discussed the conditions under which a machine could be considered to be intelligent, and introduced what is now known as the <a href="#">Turing test</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="ai-winter">AI winter</h3>
        <p>AI research was revived by the commercial success of <a href="#">expert systems</a>, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's <a href="#">fifth-generation computer</a> project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.</p>

        <h3 id="modern-ai">Modern AI</h3>
        <p>In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for <a href="#">logistics</a>, <a href="#">data mining</a>, <a href="#">medical diagnosis</a> and other areas. The success was due to increasing computational power, greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields, and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.</p>

        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <p>AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the <a href="#">AI effect</a>.</p>

          <div>Modern AI applications span across multiple industries including healthcare, transportation, finance, and entertainment.</div>
        </div>

        <p>High-profile examples of AI include <a href="#">autonomous vehicles</a> (such as drones and <a href="#">self-driving cars</a>), <a href="#">medical diagnosis</a>, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), <a href="#">search engines</a> (such as Google search), <a href="#">online assistants</a> (such as Siri), <a href="#">image recognition</a> in photographs, <a href="#">spam filtering</a>, predicting flight delays, prediction of judicial decisions, targeting online advertisements, and <a href="#">energy storage</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy and ethics</h2>
        <p>There are three philosophical questions related to AI: whether artificial general intelligence is possible; whether intelligence can be computed; and whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states. The field of <a href="#">machine ethics</a> is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering ethical principles, or training machines to behave in a manner that minimizes harm to humans, animals, other agents, and the environment.</p>
